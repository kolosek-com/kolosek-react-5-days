Todays' task is to implement what is visually described in src/task-mockup.png file.

It should be a single page application to list, add, search, edit and delete documents.

If no document is selected, edit and delete buttons are disabled, and a message is shown instead of form to select a document to edit or to add new one.

Pencil icon shown in a mockup should have a save functionality - changes are not saved until it's pressed. Remember to somehow display in the list if document was edited but not saved. (I'll leave to your creativity what happens if trying to select/add another document without saving previous one)

Delete icon should trigger a confirm dialog before actually deleting a document.

Search is both by title and document content.

What the app will look like is up to you, but it's necessary for it to look nice/real app like.

*Usage of state management library is optional
